# Hackaton
> ## My final project of Python.ðŸ‘‘
**THIS PROJECT IS ABOUT NATURE.**
My projecy will consist in a vlog with an artificial inteligence.
- ***WEB***: is going to talk about what is the climate change and the consequences
- ***AI***: is going to give tips of how we can save the planet by using things that we have, etc.

> ## Colours
- Maybe I can use the colours green and pink (light pink) and many decorations like flowers or butterflies.
- Also the letter could be in colour white or black depending the images that I'm going to introduce.
